## ðŸ“š Verification Resources

### Formal Proofs
All Lean 4 formal proofs are in the security repository:
https://github.com/Chronos-Vault/chronos-vault-security/tree/main/formal-verification

### Verification Tools Setup
Halmos, Echidna, Slither configuration:
`contracts/verification/` (this repository)

### Philosophy Document

## ðŸš€ Run Verification Yourself

```bash
# Lean 4 formal proofs
cd formal-verification
lake build

# Symbolic testing + fuzzing
cd contracts/verification
npm install
npm run verify:all
```

**Note**: Previous Certora configuration has been removed. We now use 100% open-source tools.
