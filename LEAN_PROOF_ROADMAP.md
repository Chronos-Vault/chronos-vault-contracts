# Lean 4 Formal Verification Roadmap

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Chronos Vault has established a **formal verification framework** using Lean 4 theorem prover to mathematically prove security properties of the Trinity Protocol. The architecture is complete, theorem statements are defined, and proof completion is in progress.

**Current Status:** 39 theorem statements formally defined | 51 proof obligations remaining

**Philosophy:** "Trust Math, Not Humans" - Every security claim will be cryptographically verifiable through mathematical proof, not just human audit.

## 🔐 Security Guarantee

**Upon Completion:**

> *"Every security property of Chronos Vault's Trinity Protocol has been mathematically proven using the Lean 4 theorem prover. The proofs are publicly verifiable, open-source, and automatically checked via CI/CD. Unlike traditional audits that rely on human review, our guarantees are derived from mathematical certainty - provably secure under stated cryptographic assumptions."*
