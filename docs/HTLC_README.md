# HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contracts) - Production Ready

## HTLCBridgeStandalone.sol

**Pure cryptographic security** - Production deployment ready

### Security Model
- **Hash Lock**: Keccak256 cryptographic guarantee (~10^-39 attack probability)
- **Time Lock**: Immutable blockchain-enforced deadlines  
- **Atomic Execution**: Both parties succeed OR both get refunded

### Production Advantages
✅ Zero external dependencies  
✅ No fees (only gas costs)  
✅ Simpler audit surface  
✅ Faster execution  
✅ Battle-tested HTLC pattern  

### Use Cases
- Atomic swaps
- DEX integrations
- Escrow services
- Cross-chain swaps (cryptographic security)

## Future: Trinity-Enhanced HTLC

A Trinity Protocol v3.5.4 enhanced version will be developed as an optional wrapper for teams requiring:
- Multi-chain consensus (2-of-3 quorum)
- Institutional compliance
- Formal verification integration

**Status**: Under development - standalone version recommended for production
